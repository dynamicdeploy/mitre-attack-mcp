## Key Features

* 50+ Tools for MITRE ATT&CK Querying
  * Comprehensive access to the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base through structured API tools
* Automatic ATT&CK Navigator Layer Generation
  * Generate visual representations of techniques used by threat actors
* Threat Actor and Malware Attribution
  * Query relationships between malware, threat actors, and techniques
* Technique Overlap Analysis
  * Compare techniques used by different threat actors or malware families

## Installation

To clone and run this server, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [PipX](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) installed on your computer.

1. Ensure Git, Python, and PipX have been installed using their official respective installation instructions for Windows/Mac/Linux

```bash
# Install the MCP Server using PipX
pipx install git+https://github.com/stoyky/mitre-attack-mcp
```

## How To Use

### Configure with Claude AI Desktop

1. Open Claude's MCP server configuration file.

#### Windows

```
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
# or
C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

#### Linux

```bash
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

#### Mac

* TBA

2. Add the following to that file if it doesn't already exist. If it already exists, merge the two JSON structures accordingly.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mitre-attack": {
      "command": "mitre-attack-mcp",
      "args": [
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: By default the MCP server stores the mitre-related data in the current users default cache directory. You can specify a custom data directory to use with the following config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mitre-attack": {
      "command": "mitre-attack-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--data-dir",
        "<path-to-data-dir>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Changelog

* v1.0.2 - Now installable via PipX on Windows, Mac, and Linux. "data directory" argument is now optional and will use the default cache directory if omitted.
* v1.0.0 - Initial release
* V1.0.1 - Improved robustness of layer metadata generation and error handling in layer generation function

## Use Cases

* Query for detailed information about specific malware, tactics, or techniques
* Discover relationships between threat actors and their tools
* Generate visual ATT&CK Navigator layers for threat analysis
* Find campaign overlaps between different threat actors
* Identify common techniques used by multiple malware families
